Here's how it works:
The microprocessor is able to take in a file of 16 digits from 0 - 9. Comments are allowed with the prefix of //.
Do note though, that any input with more than 16 numbers will produce an error cuz it aint built for that.

Here's what each instruction does:

0 - Halts
1 - adds 1 to R
2 - adds 2 to R
3 - adds 4 to R
4 - adds 8 to R
7 - Meant to ring a bell, I just made it print out something
8 - Prints whatevers in R in decimal
9 - prints whatevers in R in hexadecimal

So; R, IP and IS? I'll explain.
R - the register: Basically, you use this to add and print stuff. Its very general and versatile in its purpose.
IP - this will normally be pointing at whatever cell the microcprocessor was last running
IS - this will, to my knowledge, store the last instruction your microprocessor has executed

anyways to load something into the microprocessor, just make a text file and put in your instructions. It literally goes like:
1 2 8 4 8 3 1 8
Just open that and yeah
